<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  mano buddhi ahankara chittani naaham

na cha vyoma bhumir na tejo na vaayuhu
chidananda rupah shivo'ham shivo'ham

I am not any aspect of the mind like the intellect, the ego or the memory,

I am not the space, nor the earth, nor fire, nor air, I am the form of consciousness and bliss, am Shiva (that which is not)...

chidananda rupah shivo'ham shivo'ham

I am not the Vital Life Energy (Prana), nor the Five Vital Airs (manifestations of Prana),

I am the form of consciousness and bliss, I am Shiva (that which is not)...

There is no hatred nor passion in me, no greed nor delusion,
There is no pride, nor jealousy in me,

I am not virtue nor vice, not pleasure or pain,
I need no mantras, no pilgrimage, no scriptures or rituals,

na cha sangatham naiva muktir na meyaha
chidananda rupah shivo'ham shivo'ham

I am devoid of duality, my form is formlessness,
I am omnipresent, I exist everywhere, pervading all senses,
